Hello this is Newberry's Odin Recipe project where I will create a few webpages that interconnect to form a basic HTML website. Some of the basic HTML elements demonstrated are: boilerplate setup, headings and paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, and images and links. Please note all the materials used to make this website came from allrecipes.com and The Odin Project.
